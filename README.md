## User Case  

The user will add the courses they are currently taking. The courses will then be automatically displayed in a calendar with details about the course. The user can also add real-time athletic events provided by the university at a certain date. If the user double taps on a date on the calendar they will be provided with a map that displays where each class is and provide a path with the distance for each class of the day.

## Future Goals 
- Incorporate more University APIâ€™s: Waterloo, UFT, UBC etc.

- Weekly calendar for better viewing or incorporate Apples build in calendar.
